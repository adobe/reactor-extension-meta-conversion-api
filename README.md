# Meta's Conversions API extension for Adobe Experience Cloud (server-side)

The Conversions API allows advertisers to send web events from their servers directly to Meta. Server events are linked to a pixel and are processed like browser pixel events. This means that server events are used in measurement, reporting, and optimization in the same way as browser pixel events. [Learn More](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api).

This repository contains the extension/plug-in that advertisers can install on their property and send signals to Meta's Conversions API.

(This feature may not be available to you. Contact your Meta representative for more details.)
